# Cod Structure

This project is made to satify the requirments of the EMSE (European Master in Software Engineering). The project is divided in several modules. These are the 
1) SCOPE_MODEL
2) RECOGNITION_COMPONENT 
3) QUALITY_MODEL
4) TRAINED MODELS: has the trained models for the deepCNNs


### Installing

This framework was built entirely in python and pynotebooks. The modules need python 3.7 to run and many are run in notebooks. The Quality Model and Recongition Component should also be run with a GPU. Details for login in the google colab is included. Most of the data is included in the TSD however, there are some that were too large. These are uploaded to the Fraunhofer IESE portal. Each of the submodules contains information in the notebook on how to be run.

Some of the file paths may need to be adjusted, however, many are configured to be relative paths. Should there be any questions on running it, please contact me at lucia.berger@mail.mcgill.ca.
