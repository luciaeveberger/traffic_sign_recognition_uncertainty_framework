## Design Documentation 



## Code: 

Code sits in the CompiledCode Folder. There are two modules of interest. The Quality Modelling and the Scope Modelling.

## Quality Modelling

The Quality Modelling is kept in Google Drive because of the GPU and storage space available. The models train on large data samples and require a GPU. This environment also is not dependent on environmental setup. The README's in these directories explain how the code is used. 


## Scope Model: 

(Q1.4) Can potentially relevant scope factor be identified?

(Q1.5) Can required scope factor evaluation results be provided by a scope model?

(Q1.6) Which approach can be used to determine the likelihood of scope compliance?  


# 5_2_1.Scope Model 
The Scope Model is an object oriented composition.
